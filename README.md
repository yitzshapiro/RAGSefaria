# The RAG Sefaria Project

Welcome to the RAG Sefaria Project, where we'll be building the first agentic application that can compile source sheets and answer in depth questions based on Jewish scripture and writings.

Note: Before running these notebooks, be sure you've started Docker and are running a Qdrant instance. For more info, please visit [Qdrant's Website](https://qdrant.tech/)
